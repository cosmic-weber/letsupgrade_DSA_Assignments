Q-1) What is the time, space complexity of following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + 1;
}

Ans) time complexity of first loop = O(N)
     time complexity of second loop = O(M)
     Therefore, O(N + M) time, O(1) space
     
     
Q-2) What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs

Ans) b
